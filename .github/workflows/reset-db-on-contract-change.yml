            The database has been automatically reset to remove old data from the previous contract deployment.
            
            ### What happened:
            - Contract address changed in \`src/lib/contract.ts\`
            - Database data was automatically cleared (sources and questions tables)
            - Database schema was preserved
            - All existing questions and sources have been removed
            
            ### Next steps:
            - Verify the new contract is working correctly
            - Test the application with the new contract
            - Monitor for any issues
